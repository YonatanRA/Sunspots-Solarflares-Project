# Sunspots-Solarflares-Project

## Overview

The goal of this project is to find out the correlation between the sunspots and solarflares. My hipothesis is that correlation exists.

## Data

The flares dataset is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/heliodata/instruments-solarflares), thanks to [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04412). The dataset about sunspots is from the [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/data/SIDC/SUNSPOTS_D-Total-Sunspot-Numbers-Daily) API.


## Workflow

For this project I build a pipeline with all functions to make the statatistics, plots and the report. Just executing the file main.py or main.ipynb all work is done.

# Sunspots-Solarflares-Project

## Overview

The goal of this project is for you to practice what you have learned in the Intermediate Python and Data Engineering chapter of this program. For this project, you will start with a data set of your choice. You will need to import it, use your newly-acquired skills to build a data pipeline that processes the data and produces a result. You should demonstrate your proficiency with the tools we covered (functions, list comprehensions, string operations, and error handling) in your pipeline.

---

## Technical Requirements

The technical requirements for this project are as follows:

* You must construct a data pipeline with the majority of your code wrapped in functions.
* Each data pipeline stage should be covered: acquisition, wrangling, analysis, and reporting.
* You must demonstrate all the topics we covered in the chapter (functions, list comprehensions, string operations, and error handling) in your processing of the data.
* There should be some data set that gets imported and some result that gets exported.
* Your code should be saved in a Python executable file (.py), your data should be saved in a folder named data, and your results should be saved in a folder named output.
* You should also include a README.md file that describes the steps you took and your thought process as you built your data pipeline.
